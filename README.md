##  Projects

### 🧬 Epidemiology Simulation – Java | Agent-Based Modeling

- Built a tool that simulates how diseases spread in different types of social networks.
- Ran multiple “what-if” scenarios to understand how infection and recovery rates affect the spread.
- Designed the system to be flexible, so it can be reused or extended for future research.
